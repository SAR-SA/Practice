        <h2><strong>Bio</strong></h2>
        <p>Ryu (Japanese: リュウ, Hepburn: Ryū) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of Capcom's Street
            Fighter series.[6] Having premiered in the first Street Fighter in 1987, Ryu appears as the game's lead
            character alongside his best friend Ken Masters. Other games in the series show Ryu to be highly focused on
            his training, aiming to become the strongest he can. In some games, Ryu has an alternative form known as
            Evil Ryu (殺意の波動に目覚めたリュウ, Satsui no Hadō ni Mezameta Ryū, lit. "Ryu with the surge of murderous intent
            awakened", abbreviated Satsui Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 3), which is the form Ryu takes while he is under
            the domination of the surge of murderous intent. Ryu purges the surge of murderous intent manifesting in
            Street Fighter V, an independent being called Kage (影, lit. Shadow), or in Japan by the full name Kage-naru
            mono (影ナル者, lit. Shadowed One).<br>

            <br>He was created by Manabu Takemura and Takashi Nishiyama. Nishiyama's inspiration was the martial artist Mas
            Oyama. For his second appearance, Ryu's design changed from that of a young fighter to a skilled karate
            practitioner. However, because of issues in the making of Street Fighter II he possessed a major weakness
            within the cast. For the next titles, Ryu's fighting style was modified, so he had different skills with
            Evil Ryu and Kage possessing more diverse moves. Multiple voice actors have voiced the character in both
            Japanese and English series' releases.</br>

            <br>Ryu has been the lead character of the Street Fighter series since the first game and has appeared as a
            playable character in several crossover games involving the franchise, including the Marvel vs. Capcom
            series, Project X Zone, and the Super Smash Bros. series. He is also featured in manga and anime adaptations
            and the 1994 live-action film. Ryu has become one of gaming's most iconic fighting game characters, but his
            evil persona has been criticized for retaining most of his regular form's moves.</br></p>
